Rootify is a web-based plant nursery booking and inventory management system built using PHP and MySQL. It is designed to help plant shop owners manage plant listings, customer bookings, and stock efficiently through a centralized admin dashboard.

🚀 Problem Statement

Many local nurseries manage plant inventory and customer orders manually, which leads to:

Stock mismanagement

Order tracking issues

Lack of sales insights
